In your words, explain why the following text would NOT be considered valid HTML syntax. Additionally, predict if 'Will I be seen?' will show in the browser. Explain why or why not.
1. The <body> tag is inside the <head> and this is incorrect syntax. The <head> should be closed off before starting the <body> tag.


The message will not show up because the <body> tags are nested within the <head> tags. The <head> element contains metadata, such as the title, and other content that will not be displayed. The <body> element contains all of the content that WILL be seen.
